MusicApp
========

The MusicApp is an experimental project.

This application uses several new features of the still-developing html5 standard(Published as W3C Recommendation 28 October 2014).
Note: please open it with chrome.

###Tips for use
- Drag music files into the browser, or click the cd-icon to add files.

- **Right** click to show the playlist.

- Use arrow key **Left** and **Right** to switch between effects.

###Want to make your own effect?
1. Just create a new effect file. Make sure it is an AMD module, and do not forget to include the `analyser` module. Like this:
   
   ```js
   define(['analyser'], function(analyser){
      //write your code here
   })
   ```
    
2. Then start to write your `draw` function:

   ```js
   function draw(){}
   return {
      draw: draw
   }
   ```
   
3. Make sure your effect file is loaded by the `visualizer` module.

4. When you done, open in browser, switch to your new effect and have fun:D
